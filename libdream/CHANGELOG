June 11, 2001 - Netplay VOOT custom distribution
- GD-ROM accessors
- bfont modifications
- A lot.

Dec 27, 2000 - Release 6 (0.95)
- Added experimental 800x608 mode for VGA boxes; AFAIK it doesn't work
  with any composite outputs but it might work with RGB.
- Fixed problems with TA on the VGA box. I don't really understand why
  the main TA fix worked, but I'm not complaining right now.
- Fixed a bug in serial_read that made it not work
- Backported the full TA init fix from KOS
- Shotgun backport of the cdrom and fs_iso9660 modules from KOS. This should
  replace the last of the non-Cryptic-Allusion code in libdream.
- Spu example now uses 'gcc' instead of 'cc' to try to be more compatible
  with Cygwin

Oct 24, 2000 - Release 4.5 =) (0.71)
- Fixed a bug in the SCART support; this ought to really be working now!

Oct 22, 2000 - Release 4 (0.7)
- Potentially fixed the European SCART bug (SCART was being set like
  VGA and not RGB)
- vram_size has changed to represent the size of the entire video
  RAM, not just a visible screen.
- Added ta.c/ta.h for rudimentary accelerated PVR support
- New serial.c to replace serial.s/tty.c; this is one of several modules
  ported back from the new OS
- Added biosfont.c for usage of the 24x12 BIOS font
- Entirely new maple subsystem (sorry if this breaks your code, the older
  one was getting unmaintainable)
- Now compiling with -m4-single-only for floating point support; make
  sure your libc matches or printf will quit working!! Also now using -Wall.
- Added 320x240 support (dc_setup also changes; sorry again)
- Added keyboard support (including a buffering/queueing system)
- Added VMU block and LCD support (no FS support)
- Added mouse support
- Removed aica_fw and supporting SPU functions (didn't work!)
- All function names changed back to their non-dc_ equivalents... sorry
  once again! =) See ld06compat.h for some solace.
- Removed sh-stub.c .. it's getting old and crusty and you can get a 
  much better one from Fulg. If you really want it, look on my DCDev site.
- Added SH4 timer support and the corresponding sleep function has been
  fixed; it ought to be VERY accurate now.
- Now libdream comes with examples in the "examples" subdirectory, and 
  some documention in "docs". These will probably be improved over time.
- New and much improved README ^_^

Sep 13, 2000 - Release 3 (0.6)
- Changed the way the fonts work -- now they do transparency instead of
  setting the background to black
- Tweaked a few more things in the GD module (cdfs.c)
- No longer clearing the sound ram on program load, only on snd_init
- snd_init stops the ARM processor so that you can exit your program
  peacefully with no sound
- Added a dc_serial_disable() call so you can easily disable all serial
  access in your code. Good for burning to a CD, because if you are using
  serial then no one without a cable can run your program (RTS/CTS).
- Replaced the volume code in aica_fw to more closely match the s3mplay
  code. This still isn't terribly functional.
- Fixed (in theory) dc_get_buttons
- Fixed video vertical offset so it's not off the screen
- Fixed some C++ comments floating around in the library

Aug 14, 2000 - Release 2 (0.5), started changelog
