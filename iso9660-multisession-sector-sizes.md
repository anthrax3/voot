# iso9660/multisession sector sizes

(705600 bytes - AUDIO.RAW) / (300 sectors)  
= 2352 bytes / sector

11700 LBA sectors / 2048 (bytes / LBA sector) =  
300 audio + 150 pre-gap + 11250 lead-in/out

Need:
45000 sectors - 150 pre-gap - 11250 lead-in/out  
= 33600 sectors AUDIO * 2352 (bytes / sector)
